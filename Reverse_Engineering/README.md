# Static analysis

-   **[BinWalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk):** A firmware extraction tool that extracts code snippets inside any binary by searching for signatures against many standard binary file formats like `zip, tar, exe, ELF,` etc. Binwalk has a database of binary header signatures against which the signature match is performed. The common objective of using this tool is to extract a file system like `Squashfs, yaffs2, Cramfs, ext*fs, jffs2,` etc., which is embedded in the firmware binary. The file system has all the application code that will be running on the device.
-   **[Firmware ModKit (FMK)](https://www.kali.org/tools/firmware-mod-kit/)**: FMK is widely used for firmware reverse engineering. It extracts the firmware using `binwalk` and outputs a directory with the firmware file system. Once the code is extracted, a developer can modify desired files and repack the binary file with a single command.   
-   **[FirmWalker](https://github.com/craigz28/firmwalker)**: Searches through the extracted firmware file system for unique strings and directories like `etc/shadow`, `etc/passwd`, `etc/ssl`, special keywords like `admin, root, password`, etc., vulnerable binaries like `ssh, telnet, netcat` etc.

# Dynamic analysis

-   **[Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/)**: Qemu is a free and open-source emulator and enables working on cross-platform environments. The tool provides various ways to emulate binary firmware for different architectures like Advanced RISC Machines (ARM), Microprocessors without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS), etc., on the host system. Qemu can help in full-system emulation or a single binary emulation of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files for the Linux system and many different platforms.
-   **[Gnu DeBugger (GDB)](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/)**[:](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) GDB is a dynamic debugging tool for emulating a binary and inspecting its memory and registers. GDB also supports remote debugging, commonly used during firmware reversing when the target binary runs on a separate host and reversing is carried out from a different host.
