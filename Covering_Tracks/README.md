- [kali-anonsurf](https://github.com/Und3rf10w/kali-anonsurf): Sources of both the anonsurf and pandora packages from ParrotSec combined into one. Pandora automatically overwrites the RAM when the system is shutting down. Anonsurf will anonymize the entire system under TOR using IPTables. It will also allow you to start and stop i2p as well.
- [whonix](https://www.whonix.org/): security hardened Linux distribution. Its main goals are to provide strong privacy and anonymity on the Internet. The operating system consists of two virtual machines, a "Workstation" and a Tor "Gateway", running Debian GNU/Linux. All communications are forced through the Tor network.
