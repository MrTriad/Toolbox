# 4 Vulnerability Analysis

## 4.1 <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/" style="color:white">Mitre CWE</a>
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It has numerous categories of weaknesses that means that CWE can be effectively employed by the community as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. Further, CWE has an advanced search technique with which you can search and view the weaknesses based on research concepts, development concepts, and architectural concepts.

## 4.2 <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html" style="color:white">Mitre CVE</a>
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures. It is used to discuss or share information about a unique software or firmware vulnerability, provides a baseline for tool evaluation, and enables data exchange for cybersecurity automation.

## 4.3 <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search" style="color:white">National Vulnerability Database</a>
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). These data enable the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.
