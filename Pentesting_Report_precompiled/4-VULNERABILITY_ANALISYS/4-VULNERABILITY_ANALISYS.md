# 4 Vulnerability Analysis

## 4.1 <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/" style="color:white">Mitre CWE</a>
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It has numerous categories of weaknesses that means that CWE can be effectively employed by the community as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. Further, CWE has an advanced search technique with which you can search and view the weaknesses based on research concepts, development concepts, and architectural concepts.

## 4.2 <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html" style="color:white">Mitre CVE</a>
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures. It is used to discuss or share information about a unique software or firmware vulnerability, provides a baseline for tool evaluation, and enables data exchange for cybersecurity automation.

## 4.3 <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search" style="color:white">National Vulnerability Database</a>
The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). These data enable the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.

## 4.4 <a href="https://openvas.org/" style="color:white">OpenVAS</a>
OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low-level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implement any vulnerability test.

### Installation
To install OpenVAS on Kali Linux use these commands:
```
sudo apt update                      
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y

sudo apt install openvas
```

Run the following command to start the setup process:
```
gvm-setup
```

After the configuration process is complete, all the necessary OpenVAS processes will start and the web interface will open automatically. The web interface is running locally on port 9392. OpenVAS will also set up an admin account and automatically generate a password for this account which is displayed in the last section of the setup output.
You can go to <a href="https://localhost:9392" style="color:white">this link</a> to start OpenVAS.
NOTE: to check your installation use this command:
```
gvm-check-setup
```

Use these commands to start/stop the OpenVAS services:
```
sudo gvm-start
sudo gvm-stop
```

If you want to add a new user use this command:
```
sudo runuser -u _gvm -- gvmd --create-user=admin2 --new-password=12345
```

To change the password of an existing user use this command:
```
sudo runuser -u _gvm -- gvmd --user=admin --new-password=new_password 
```

Now you are ready to use OpenVAS

### Report
NOTE: you can download your report from OpenVAS.
```
<ATTACH_FILE>
```

### NOTE

If OpenVAS can't find config files you can try to import files from `/var/lib/gvm/data-objects/gvmd/20.08/configs` in Configurations > Scan Config in the OpenVAS interface.
Or try to run `sudo gvm-feed-update`.

If that still does not the trick try running the following commands:
```
sudo runuser -u _gvm -- gvmd --get-scanners
sudo runuser -u _gvm -- gvmd --get-users --verbose
sudo runuser -u _gvm -- gvmd --modify-scanner [scanner id] --value [user id]
```

If you still got problems on it search Google!

## 4.6 <a href="https://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/gfi-languard/download/" style="color:white">GFI LanGuard</a> (Needs Registration)
GFI LanGuard scans, detects, assesses, and rectifies security vulnerabilities in your network and connected devices. It scans the network and ports to detect, assess, and correct security vulnerabilities, with minimal administrative effort. It scans your OSes, virtual environments, and installed applications through vulnerability check databases. It enables you to analyze the state of your network security, identify risks, and address how to take action before it is compromised.

### Installation
You need to register first, after you download the app, start the installation (languard.exe).

## 4.7 CGI Scanner Nikto
Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files and HTTP server options; it will also attempt to identify installed web servers and software.

### Usage
```
nikto -h
nikto -H
```

### Site Report
To get site report on a document use the following options:
```
-o [file_name] to set the file name
-F [file_format] to set the file format
